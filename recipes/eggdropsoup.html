    <h3>Savory egg drop soup</h3>

        <p>For years I ate what I thought had been faux egg drop soup cobbled together by a hungry student, however, it was only recently I discovered that my recipe was actually quite accurate. With the addition of some cornstarch and the use of white pepper, this homemade soup is dead ringer for the soup at your favorite Chinese-American restaurant.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock, homemade preferred</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>Scant 1/2 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if cooking gluten-free)</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup enoki mushrooms or sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once your ingredients are assembled, we can start cooking!</p>
    
    <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the cornstarch slurry: Measure out 1/2 cup of the stock and mix with the cornstarch until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Put stock, ginger, soy sauce, onions, mushrooms, white pepper in pot and bring to boil: Place the remaining chicken stock, ginger, soy sauce, green onions, mushrooms and white pepper in a pot and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Stir in the corn starch slurry and reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in beaten eggs: Slowly pour in the beaten eggs while stirring the soup while stirring slowly. The egg will spread out into ribbons.</li>
            <li>Serve: Turn off the heat and garnish with a few more chopped green onions. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
